ARM  (advance RISC machine)[1990]

# Introduction 
- 32 bit microcontroller 
- series  AX, RX , Mx 

# Features
- RISC (reduce instructions set computing)
- LOAD and Store (Operations are only in the registers only Load and Store operations are in the memory)
- Multilevel pipeline  (three level pipeline) to speed up flow of instructions .
- The instructions set of Arm is uniform and fixed in length 32 bit ARM Processor have two instruction set :general 32 bit ARM instruction set and 16-bit Thumb instruction Set.
# ARM Family
